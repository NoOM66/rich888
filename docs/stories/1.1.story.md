# Story 1.1: เกมเรียนรู้ภาวะเงินเฟ้อ - Core Gameplay Loop

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to manage personal resources (money, health, happiness, education) within a simulated inflationary environment,
**so that** I can understand the impact of inflation on daily life and personal finance, and learn to adapt and manage for survival and growth.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  The game features a core loop with weekly turns, time budget, travel, activities, and stress management.
2.  The game includes 4 core stats: Money, Health, Happiness, Education (and Stress), with clear trade-offs.
3.  The game implements recurring upkeep expenses: weekly food, bi-weekly rent (every 4 weeks), and clothing purchases (every 6 weeks).
4.  The game includes a job progression system with levels, wages, and promotion requirements.
5.  The game features a banking/financial system for deposits, loans, and repayments.
6.  The game includes a map with locations and travel time between nodes.
7.  The game incorporates inflation mechanics: changing prices of goods/services, inflation reducing cash value, and inflation-adjusted banking (low deposit interest, fluctuating loan interest, basic investments).
8.  The game includes inflation-related random events.
9.  The game's data model and weekly workflow pseudocode incorporate `inflation_rate` and inflation impact calculations.
10. The game's vision and goals include "financial security in inflation" or "asset growth beating inflation".
11. The game includes a housing system with inflation-adjusted rent and utilities.
12. The game includes a "CookAtHome" mechanic for cost savings.
13. The UI includes a "Projected Panel" showing forecasted results, real purchasing power, or inflation-adjusted asset value.
14. The UI includes notifications for upkeep, inflation rates, and price changes.

## Dev Notes
**Data Models:**
Refer to "6. แบบจำลองข้อมูล (Data Model)" in GDD for Player, Job, Action, Location, WeeklyRules, HousingTier, and Investment data structures.

**Technical Considerations:**
- **Platform Requirements:** PC (Windows, macOS), Web (HTML5)
- **Technology Preferences:**
    - Frontend: Unity (C#) หรือ Godot (GDScript) หรือ Web (TypeScript/React)
    - Backend: (May not be necessary for MVP if standalone game)
    - Database: (May not be necessary for MVP if standalone game)
- **Architecture Considerations:**
    - Repository Structure: Separate Game Logic, UI, Data

**Missing Guidance (Needs further clarification):**
- API Specifications
- Component Specifications (beyond repository structure)
- Specific File Locations (beyond general repository structure)
- Testing Requirements
- Security/Compliance (from GDD)
- Browser/OS Support (from GDD)
- Performance Requirements (from GDD)
- Service Architecture (from GDD)
- Integration Requirements (from GDD)
